# Python-DSA-practice
- This repository is created for python Data structure and Algorithm practice, every code has been cleany updated with the time and space complexity. Each concept is updated topic wise with their respective folders in a proper strucuture 

## Start Date 
- 22nd Dec 2025

## Objective 
- 1.To understand and implement Data Structures and Algorithms concepts.
- 2.Build a strong foundation for python.
- 3.Deep understanding and improving the effeciency of the problem solving 
- 4.Building confidence and displine in programming daily
- 5.Growing more and more by improving daily.

## Structure 
- Each topic is a folder which has its concept problems stored inside them.
- Every topic is driven deeper with problem solving and core idea problems.
- There is a separate folder named Weekly_Progress/ which stores reports for every week

## Goal 
- Everyday i will solve two problems and commit them on the same day consistently.
- Weekly plans are well defined and reports updated 
- Monthly tracking and improvements will be done as per analysis and self understanding.

## How I work
- Every day with two problems.
- First I will understand what the problem is and how we humans solve it by mathematical or logical thinking.
- Later I will try to implement my own program and I managed to reach brute force without internet help as I know the fundamentals of python already.
- I will find the time and space complexity of the code and check for minor checks and think for optmized method.
- I search the algorithm and learn the steps deeply and try to implement.
- Later write command lines for time and space complexity and commit the changes and push it to the repository.

## Resources 
- Topics in GeeksforGeeks.
- AI agents for better understanding and doubts solving.
- Youtube for understanding optimized algorithms for problems.

## Progress Report
- Weekly goals.
- Problems solved.
- Topics covered.
- Key learning and improvements.
